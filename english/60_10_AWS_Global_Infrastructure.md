## 6.1 AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS Global Infrastructure serves as the foundation for delivering AI and machine learning solutions with global reach, high performance, and robust reliability. This worldwide network of computing resources enables organizations of all sizes to build, train, and deploy AI/ML workloads at scale, regardless of geographic location.[^1700] For business professionals implementing AI initiatives, understanding this infrastructure directly impacts application performance, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Knowledge of AWS Global Infrastructure is also a core component of the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam.

AWS's worldwide network empowers diverse AI implementations—from innovative startups creating new AI applications to global enterprises deploying organization-wide ML solutions. By leveraging this infrastructure, businesses can build resilient, compliant, and high-performing AI/ML solutions that operate efficiently across international boundaries, gaining competitive advantage in increasingly AI-driven markets.

### Understanding AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations

AWS Global Infrastructure consists of three key components that work together to provide a resilient environment for AI and ML workloads:

**AWS Regions** are discrete geographic areas containing multiple, isolated, and physically separate Availability Zones. Each Region functions independently of other Regions, enhancing fault tolerance and stability. AWS continues to expand its Region footprint worldwide, particularly in emerging markets where AI adoption is accelerating.[^1701]

**Availability Zones** (AZs) are distinct locations within a Region engineered to isolate failures from other AZs. These zones connect to each other through low-latency network links while maintaining physical separation. This architecture enables highly available, fault-tolerant applications and databases that surpass what a single data center could achieve.[^1702]

**Edge Locations** are sites used by Amazon CloudFront to cache content closer to end users, dramatically reducing latency.[^1703] Separate from Regions and AZs, Edge Locations typically operate in major cities and population centers. These locations are particularly valuable for AI/ML applications requiring low-latency processing, such as real-time image recognition or natural language processing services.

The relationship between these components is illustrated in the following diagram:

### Answers and Explanations

1. **Correct answer: C. Edge Locations**

   Explanation: Edge Locations are specifically designed to cache content and reduce latency for end-users worldwide. They are part of Amazon CloudFront, AWS's content delivery network, and are ideal for caching AI model results or serving low-latency inference globally.[^1715] Availability Zones and Regions are more suited for hosting primary infrastructure, while Data Centers are the physical facilities that make up AZs.

2. **Correct answer: C. Data residency and compliance requirements**

   Explanation: When dealing with sensitive healthcare data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations is paramount. The subchapter emphasizes that data residency and compliance should be the primary consideration when choosing a Region for projects involving sensitive data. While factors like latency, cost, and hardware availability are important, they are secondary to meeting legal and regulatory requirements in the healthcare sector.[^1716]

3. **Correct answer: D. Deploy the chatbot across multiple Regions and use Edge Locations**

   Explanation: To achieve global deployment with minimal latency, the best strategy is to leverage multiple AWS Regions and Edge Locations. This approach allows the chatbot to be hosted closer to users in different geographic areas (using Regions) while also utilizing Edge Locations for even faster content delivery and potentially for running inference at the edge. This strategy aligns with the global reach and low latency benefits discussed in the subchapter.[^1717]

4. **Correct answer: C. Use instances in multiple Availability Zones within the same Region**

   Explanation: To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, the best practice is to distribute resources across multiple Availability Zones within the same Region. This approach, as described in the subchapter, allows for continued operation even if one AZ experiences issues. Using multiple Regions would be unnecessary and potentially complicate data consistency, while using a single AZ or relying solely on Edge Locations would not provide the desired fault tolerance.[^1718]

5. **Correct answer: C. Deploy all AI models to every available AWS Region**

   Explanation: Deploying all AI models to every available AWS Region is not a cost-effective strategy. The subchapter emphasizes choosing the right Regions based on factors like user location, data residency, and specific service needs. Deploying everywhere would lead to unnecessary costs and complexity. The other options are valid cost-optimization strategies mentioned in the subchapter: choosing Regions with favorable pricing, using EC2 Spot Instances for training, and leveraging Edge Locations for low-latency inference are all recommended approaches.[^1719]
