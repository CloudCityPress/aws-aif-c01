### Defining Basic AI Terms

Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses a broad range of technologies and approaches designed to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. To navigate the AI landscape effectively, it's crucial to understand the following key terms:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The overarching field of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human-like cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.[^201]

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.[^202]

- **Deep Learning**: A specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model and process complex patterns in data.[^203]

- **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.[^204]

- **Computer Vision**: A field of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.[^205]

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The branch of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.[^206]

- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a real-world process, trained on data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.[^207]

- **Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions given to an AI system to help it learn from data and make decisions.[^208]

- **Training**: The process of teaching a machine learning model to make predictions by showing it many examples of input data and the corresponding correct outputs.[^209]

- **Inferencing**: The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.[^210]

- **Bias**: Systematic errors in AI systems that can lead to unfair or inaccurate outcomes, often reflecting human biases present in the training data or algorithm design.[^211]

- **Fairness**: The principle of ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, or age.[^212]

- **Fit**: How well a machine learning model's predictions match the actual outcomes in the training data. A good fit means the model accurately captures the underlying patterns without overfitting or underfitting.[^213]
I'll add a bullet point about Generative AI that mentions it will be covered in detail in the next chapter:

- **Generative AI**: A category of artificial intelligence that can create new content, including text, images, code, and more. These systems learn patterns from training data and generate novel outputs that reflect those patterns. Generative AI is revolutionizing numerous fields and applications. We'll explore this transformative technology in depth in the next chapter.

- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: A type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text across a wide range of topics and tasks.[^214]

To illustrate the relationships between these concepts, let's consider a diagram:
```mermaid

    style F fill:#f2e6ff
```

The above diagram illustrates the hierarchical relationship between key concepts in the AI landscape. Artificial Intelligence represents the broadest domain, encompassing all technologies that enable computers to mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on systems that learn from data without explicit programming. Deep Learning further narrows the scope as a specialized subset of Machine Learning, utilizing complex, multi-layered neural networks. The diagram also highlights important application areas of Machine Learning, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Understanding this hierarchy helps business professionals navigate AI terminology and conceptualize how specific technologies relate to broader AI initiatives.

```

This second diagram depicts the essential workflow in developing and deploying AI systems. The process begins with Data collection and preparation, which feeds into the Training phase where algorithms learn patterns from the data. This results in a Model that encapsulates the learned patterns. The model then performs Inferencing—applying what it has learned to new, unseen data. Importantly, considerations of Bias & Fairness must be integrated during model development to ensure ethical AI systems. Business leaders who understand this lifecycle can better manage AI projects, allocate appropriate resources at each stage, and implement proper governance frameworks to address ethical concerns throughout the development process.

Real-time inferencing processes data and returns predictions immediately, often within milliseconds, which is crucial for applications requiring instant decisions. In the case of fraud detection for financial transactions, the system needs to make immediate decisions to approve or flag transactions as they occur, making real-time inferencing essential.[^220]

4. **Correct answer: C. ML is a subset of AI, and Deep Learning is a subset of ML**

   Explanation: This option correctly describes the relationship between AI, ML, and Deep Learning. Artificial Intelligence is the broadest field, encompassing various approaches to create intelligent machines. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. Deep Learning is a further specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. This hierarchical relationship is fundamental to understanding the AI landscape.[^221]

5. **Correct answer: D. Tabular data**

   Explanation: The scenario describes customer information stored in a structured database, which is characteristic of tabular data. Tabular data is organized in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or database table. This type of structured data is common in business applications and is well-suited for many traditional machine learning algorithms. Understanding data types is crucial for selecting appropriate AI models and preprocessing techniques.[^222]
