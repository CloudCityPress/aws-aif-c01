## 2.1 Basic concepts of generative AI

Generative AI transforms how businesses solve problems, foster creativity, and make decisions. This powerful technology creates new content, understands complex relationships, and automates tasks that once required significant human effort. Understanding these foundations is essential for anyone taking the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam and professionals seeking to leverage AI in their organizations.

This subchapter explores generative AI's core concepts, practical applications, and the lifecycle of foundation models. Whether you're evaluating AI solutions or planning implementations, these insights will help you identify opportunities where generative AI can address business challenges and create value.

### Understanding foundational generative AI concepts

Generative AI systems combine several key technologies to create new content and solve complex problems. Let's examine the essential components that power these systems:

1. **Tokens and Chunking**

Tokens are the fundamental building blocks that generative AI models process. They can be words, word fragments, or characters, depending on the model's design. Chunking is the process of breaking down input text into these manageable tokens.[^200]

For example, the sentence "AWS is a cloud computing platform" might be tokenized as:
["AWS", "is", "a", "cloud", "comput", "ing", "platform"]. In reality tokenization also split longer words into smaller subwords, so in English, one word is roughly 1.3 tokens, in Chinese it is about 2.5 tokens, while in Arabic it's can be even 4 tokens. 

Understanding tokenization is crucial for businesses working with large language models (LLMs) as it affects model performance, cost (often based on token count), and the ability to handle different languages or specialized vocabularies.

2. **Embeddings and Vectors**

Embeddings are dense vector representations of tokens, words, or entire documents. These numerical representations capture *semantic meanings*, allowing AI models to understand relationships between different pieces of text. For example, questions "How old are you?" and "What is your age?" have the same semantic meaning, while don't have any common word. [^201]

In a business context, embeddings enable powerful applications such as semantic search, where users can find information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. For instance, a customer support system using embeddings could understand that a query about "refund policy" is related to "return procedures" even if those exact words aren't used.

3. **Prompt Engineering**

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting input prompts to elicit desired outputs from generative AI models. It involves designing clear, specific instructions that guide the model to produce the most relevant and accurate responses.[^202]

For business professionals, effective prompt engineering can significantly enhance the value derived from generative AI tools. For example, when using Amazon Bedrock to generate marketing copy, a well-crafted prompt might include specific brand guidelines, target audience information, good and bad examples, and desired tone, resulting in more tailored and effective content generation.[^203]

4. **Transformer-based LLMs**

Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are the powerhouse behind many generative AI applications. These models use a neural network architecture called the Transformer, which allows them to process and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy.[^204]
