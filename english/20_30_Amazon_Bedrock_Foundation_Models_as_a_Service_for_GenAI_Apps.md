### Answers and Explanations

1. **Correct answer: B. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails with denied topics**

   Explanation: Amazon Bedrock Guardrails with denied topics is specifically designed to prevent models from discussing predetermined subjects. For a financial services chatbot that must avoid providing investment advice, configuring denied topics ensures the model will consistently refuse to engage with investment advice queries, maintaining regulatory compliance. This is more reliable than fine-tuning (which might still generate advice) and more specific to the use case than other options.[^2318]

2. **Correct answer: B. Sensitive information filters with PII detection and VPC integration**

   Explanation: Healthcare organizations handling patient conversations require comprehensive privacy protection. Sensitive information filters specifically detect and can mask or block PII in both inputs and outputs, which is crucial for patient data. VPC integration ensures all traffic remains within the private network, adding an additional layer of security required for HIPAA compliance. This combination directly addresses both the PII protection and security requirements for healthcare data.[^2319]

3. **Correct answer: B. Implement prompt caching for repeated context and use batch processing**

   Explanation: For high-volume token processing, prompt caching can reduce costs by up to 90% and latency by up to 85% for repeated contexts, which is common in product descriptions. Batch processing offers up to 50% cost savings compared to on-demand pricing for non-time-sensitive workloads. This combination addresses both the cost concern and maintains quality, unlike switching models or using only on-demand pricing which wouldn't reduce costs.[^2320]

4. **Correct answer: C. IAM policy-based enforcement with the bedrock:GuardrailIdentifier condition key**

   Explanation: The IAM policy-based enforcement with the bedrock:GuardrailIdentifier condition key is specifically designed for centralized governance. It ensures that specific guardrails must be used with model inference calls, and requests are automatically rejected if they don't comply. This provides enterprise-wide enforcement of AI safety policies across all teams, which is exactly what the scenario requires. Other options don't provide this centralized, mandatory enforcement capability.[^2321]

5. **Correct answer: B. Guardrails safety controls currently support only English, French, and Spanish**

   Explanation: While Amazon Bedrock foundation models can process multiple languages, the Guardrails safety controls (content filters, denied topics, etc.) currently only support English, French, and Spanish. For a global company processing technical documentation in multiple languages, this limitation means they cannot rely on automated safety controls for documents in other languages, requiring additional measures for comprehensive content safety. This is a more significant limitation than the incorrect options suggest.[^2322]
