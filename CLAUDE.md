# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **documentation-only repository** — an AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) study guide by Vladimir Provorov, published by Cloud City Press. It contains no application code, build system, or test framework. All content is in Markdown files.

## Repository Structure

- `english/` — All book content as Markdown files, organized by numbered naming convention
- `README.md` — Project overview and full table of contents
- `LICENSE.md` — CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (non-commercial, no derivatives)

### File Naming Convention

Files in `english/` follow the pattern `{Part}{Section}_{Title}.md`:
- `00_*` — Front matter (cover, copyrights, introduction, links)
- `10_*` — Part 1: AI and ML Fundamentals
- `20_*` — Part 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI
- `30_*` — Part 3: Applications of Foundation Models
- `40_*` — Part 4: Guidelines for Responsible AI
- `50_*` — Part 5: Security, Compliance, and Governance
- `60_*` — Part 6: Additional Important Topics

Chapter introductions use `_00_` (e.g., `10_00_Fundamentals_of_AI_and_ML.md`), and sections increment by 10 (e.g., `10_10_`, `10_20_`, `10_30_`).

## License Constraints

Content is licensed under **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**. Do not create derivative works or modify content in ways that would violate this license. Corrections and error fixes are acceptable contributions.

## Contributing

Report errors or suggest improvements via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CloudCityPress/aws-aif-c01/issues). The table of contents in `README.md` must stay in sync with files in `english/`.
